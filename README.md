This R-Shiny application contains four idioms built with the FIFA 18 complete player dataset. The idioms are:

1. **Idiom 1** : A parallels graph to visualize the correlation between each variable. May include a map filter to reduce the number of results
2. **Idiom 2**: Cluster Analysis based on player statistics and positional data.
3. **Idiom 3**: Bubble chart to discover market value - overall relationships between different nationalities.
4. **Idiom 4**: Histogram age-potential.
